**Object Detection with YOLO-NAS**

This project focuses on performing object detection using the YOLO-NAS model on a custom dataset. It includes scripts for converting annotation formats to the YOLO format (script needs to be changed according to annotation file format), training the YOLO-NAS model on my private dataset, and then running detection using the trained model.
